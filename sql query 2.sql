-- Write an SQL query to rank the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:

-- The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
-- If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
-- After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.
-- Return the result table ordered by score in descending order.

-- Input: 
-- Scores table:
-- +----+-------+
-- | Id | Score |
-- +----+-------+
-- | 1  | 3.50  |
-- | 2  | 3.65  |
-- | 3  | 4.00  |
-- | 4  | 3.85  |
-- | 5  | 4.00  |
-- | 6  | 3.65  |
-- +----+-------+
-- Output: 
-- +-------+------+
-- | Score | Rank |
-- +-------+------+
-- | 4.00  | 1    |
-- | 4.00  | 1    |
-- | 3.85  | 2    |
-- | 3.65  | 3    |
-- | 3.65  | 3    |
-- | 3.50  | 4    |
-- +-------+------+

-- Solution ---

select Score,dense_rank() over(order by score desc) as "Rank" from Scores
